# DSA Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey as I learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains code implementations and notes for various DSA topics.

## Current Progress

- **Arrays**: Implemented basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Linked Lists**: Created singly and doubly linked lists with basic functionalities.
- **Stacks**: Developed stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queues**: Implemented queue operations using arrays and linked lists.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshit9466/DSA.git
